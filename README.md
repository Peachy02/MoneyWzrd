# MoneyWzrd
MoneyWzrd is an app combining multiple budgeting tools that allow the user to easily track and manage their financials. The main activities are the accounts, expenses, and investments pages. The investments page tracks any stock related account that the user might have. Expenses displays user entered expenses that the user might have, in a calendar format with all the due dates and specific names, with the ability to check the expense off if it is paid for. Accounts shows the user their main accounts like chequing and savings, with the option to add or delete the accounts (or edit the values). Quick at a glance windows will be displayed on the home screen of the app once the user has logged in, and this home screen with also be personalized for each user who enters the app with a greeting and the users name. Other potential activities for future development include budgeting and subscriptions. Budgeting is going to help the user make a monthly financial plan in order to stay organized with their money. Subscriptions would show the user their monthly payments towards various subscription services they participate in.
